# Spam-checker
This is an simple(beginner level) but effective tool that you can use to check for spam trigger words in your email newsletter. 

Copy your newsletter content including the subject line and paste it in the given input box and then click on the scan button. The tool will run background checks for any spam trigger words in your newsletter and post scan results below the scan button.  

Any detected Spam words will be highlighted in yellow. You can edit your newsletter and remove the words marked in yellow. If there are no words highlighted in yellow in your first scan result, then it means that your newsletter content has no spam trigger words.
